The initial output of threadSync.c made it seem like multiple threads were entering the critical 
section at the same time. THe output would say something like:

Thread 0 entered critical section
Thread 1 entered critical section
Thread 0 complete
...
..

The reason it seemed like both threads were in the critical section at the same time is because
the next thread enters the critical section as soon as the preceding thread calls sem_post(&mutex)
but before the preceding thread completes.
To convince myself that this was the case, I added a print line right after the sem_post line, to
confirm that the thread did indeed exit before the next thread entered.
